# AVL-Tree-to-handle-scheduling-airplane-landings
This code makes a self-balancing binary search tree to handle scheduling airplane landing times without conflicts

You can reserve times and see if they are available.
The project was done for a Data Structure course. Hence, the data structure is efficient (AVL TREE). It balances on its own keeping the time complexity low.
